# CS50 Readability Project

This project analyzes text to determine its reading level using the Coleman-Liau index.

## Overview
- Reads a block of text and calculates letters, words, and sentences.
- Computes a reading grade level based on the text.
- Starter code provided by CS50; my contributions focus on the calculations and logic.

## My Contributions
- Implemented functions to count letters, words, and sentences.
- Calculated the Coleman-Liau index to determine reading level.
- Tested different sample texts to ensure accuracy.

## Skills Demonstrated
- C programming and control structures
- String manipulation and iteration
- Applying algorithms to real-world problems
- Debugging and testing code
