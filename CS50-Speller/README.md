# CS50 Speller Project

This project is a spell-checker built in C as part of the CS50 course.

## Overview
- Reads a dictionary and checks words in a text file for spelling errors.
- Starter code provided by CS50; my contributions focus on core functionality.

## My Contributions

- Managed memory for words loaded from the dictionary.
- Tested and debugged key functions for correctness.

## Skills Demonstrated
- C programming and memory management
- String manipulation
- Implementing and using data structures (hash tables)
- Debugging and testing code
