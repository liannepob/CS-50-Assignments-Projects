# SwimJournal

#### Description:
SwimJournal is a full-stack web application designed to help swimmers track training, recovery, and performance progression over time. The app allows users to log swims, lifts, races, and recovery metrics, then view personalized insights through dashboards and charts.

Users begin by registering and logging into a secure account. All training data is stored per user, ensuring privacy and personalization. Upon login, users are taken to a dashboard that displays training streaks, activity streaks, weekly swim yardage, total lift sessions, and average soreness levels. These metrics help athletes monitor consistency and balance training with recovery.

The Training Index page provides a complete log of all swims, lifts, and meets. Each entry can be edited or deleted, allowing users to maintain accurate records as training plans change. The Progression page visualizes race performance using Chart.js, converting race times into seconds and plotting them over time so improvements trend upward as performance improves.

Recovery tracking is integrated through a dedicated page where users can log sleep, soreness, fatigue, and stress levels. These recovery metrics contribute to weekly averages displayed on the dashboard.

SwimJournal was built using Flask for the backend, SQLite for data storage, Jinja for templating, Chart.js for data visualization, and Bootstrap with custom CSS for responsive styling. The project emphasizes clean user experience, data integrity, and practical athletic use cases.

This project represents my final submission for CS50 and demonstrates my ability to design, build, and deploy a complete web application from scratch
